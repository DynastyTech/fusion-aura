# What is a Slug?

## Simple Explanation

A **slug** is a URL-friendly version of your product name. It's used in web addresses (URLs) to identify products.

## Examples

**Product Name:** "Premium Organic Raw Honey"  
**Slug:** `premium-organic-raw-honey`

**Product Name:** "Men's Health Supplement"  
**Slug:** `mens-health-supplement`

## Why Use Slugs?

1. **SEO-Friendly**: Search engines can understand what the product is from the URL
2. **User-Friendly**: Easy to read and remember
3. **Clean URLs**: Instead of `/products/12345`, you get `/products/premium-organic-raw-honey`

## How It Works in FusionAura

When you create a product:
- **Product Name**: "Premium Organic Raw Honey"
- **Slug** (auto-generated): `premium-organic-raw-honey`
- **URL**: `yoursite.com/products/premium-organic-raw-honey`

## Rules for Slugs

- ✅ Use lowercase letters
- ✅ Use hyphens (-) instead of spaces
- ✅ No special characters (except hyphens)
- ✅ No spaces
- ✅ Keep it short and descriptive

## Examples of Good vs Bad Slugs

✅ **Good:**
- `premium-organic-honey`
- `mens-health-supplement`
- `aloe-vera-gel`

❌ **Bad:**
- `Premium Organic Honey` (has spaces and capitals)
- `premium_organic_honey` (uses underscores)
- `premium-organic-honey!!!` (has special characters)

## In the Admin Panel

When you type a product name, the slug is **automatically generated** for you. You can edit it if needed, but usually the auto-generated one is perfect!

## Technical Note

The slug must be **unique** - no two products can have the same slug. If you try to use a slug that already exists, you'll get an error.
