# ✅ Deployment Confirmation

## Yes, You Only Buy Domain on GoDaddy!

**Correct Approach:**
- ✅ **GoDaddy**: Only for domain name purchase and DNS management
- ✅ **Vercel**: Hosts your Next.js frontend (FREE)
- ✅ **Railway**: Hosts your Node.js API backend (FREE tier available)
- ✅ **Supabase/Railway**: PostgreSQL database (FREE tier available)

**You do NOT need:**
- ❌ GoDaddy hosting
- ❌ GoDaddy VPS
- ❌ Any GoDaddy server services

**What You Pay:**
- Domain on GoDaddy: ~$10-15/year
- Everything else: FREE (or very low cost)

## How It Works

1. **Buy domain on GoDaddy** → `yourdomain.com`
2. **Point DNS to Vercel/Railway** → Update GoDaddy DNS settings
3. **Deploy code** → Push to GitHub, auto-deploys to Vercel/Railway
4. **Done!** → Your site is live at `www.yourdomain.com`

## Next Steps
